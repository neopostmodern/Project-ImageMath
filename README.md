## Description
*Todo: Add description.*

## Libraries in use

### OpenCV 3
Requires [OpenCV 3](https://github.com/Itseez/opencv) with [Extra Modules](https://github.com/Itseez/opencv_contrib). 
To install on Ubuntu read [here for OpenCV](http://docs.opencv.org/doc/tutorials/introduction/linux_install/linux_install.html#building-opencv-from-source-using-cmake-using-the-command-line) and [here for Extras](https://github.com/Itseez/opencv_contrib/blob/master/README.md#how-to-build-opencv-with-extra-modules).

### Node.js, express & socket.io
In `/NodeHost` run `npm install` and you should be set to go.

### Client-side JavaScript libraries
Current JS client dependencies are **socket.io** and **jQuery**, tied together with **require.js**.
I hope to have them set up through **bower** soon, but for now you don't have to install anything.

*socket.io client library is and will be provided by the socket.io server.* 

*TODO: drop jQuery*
